# 🌾 Harvest Hive – Empowering Agriculture with Blockchain

## 📌 Introduction
**Harvest Hive** is a blockchain-powered agricultural transaction platform designed to empower farmers through **equitable pricing**, **market access**, and **transactional transparency**. By replacing traditional opaque systems with blockchain-based smart contracts, Harvest Hive ensures accountability, builds trust, and enables fair trade across the agricultural ecosystem.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Empower farmers with fair and equitable pricing  
- ✅ Ensure complete transparency in agricultural transactions  
- ✅ Enable broad, direct market access for farmers  
- ✅ Support and regulate legitimate intermediaries for ethical trade

## 💡 Motivation
At the heart of Harvest Hive is a deep-rooted commitment to dismantle the complex, unfair agricultural supply chain. The project was born out of a need to challenge the **opaque pricing mechanisms** and **power imbalance** that marginalize producers. With **blockchain technology** as its backbone, Harvest Hive aims to illuminate every transaction, ensuring clarity, traceability, and trust for all stakeholders.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MetaMask or any Ethereum-compatible wallet
- Ganache / Ethereum testnet
- Truffle or Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/dhanarajcn/Harvest-Hive.git


* Do `npm i --force` to install the dependencies
* Open Ganache and create a new workspace
* Change directory to `truffle` and do `truffle compile` to compile the contracts
* Do `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts
* Copy the contract addresses and paste them in `src/app.js`
* Also copy the contract build to src/contracts
* Change directory to `ui` and do `npm start` to start the client
* Setup Metamask and import the accounts from Ganache
* Do transactions as normal
